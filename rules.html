        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
        coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
        detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless

          <b>DIMENSIONS</b>.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
          dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
          dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
          and older.

        <li>
          <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b>Fields used within the competition program
          must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations
          participating in the state competition program that are unable to
          provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the
          State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
          inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver
          of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues,
          districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
          field may be required to play all their games away.
